# CrossyRoads
Our project is a rough recreation of hit mobile game Crossy Roads. The gameplay can be essentially boiled down to a randomly generated, theoretically infinite game of Frogger. That is the core of our project, a game that would function on a 'random' and 'infinite' scale. That is, we wanted each trial run to be different, and for the player to be able to play until they were unable. Our final iteration succeeds in that. The environments that the player progresses through is random, that is not pregenerated, and-- assuming that they're good enough and they have a little bit of luck, they may continue infinitely.
